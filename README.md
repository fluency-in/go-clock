# Go: Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

Create a clock that is independent of date.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

The tests are written using the `testing` package in the standard library.

To run a test file use the `go test` command:

    go test
